Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms

The repository contains folders:

  1. Supervised Machine Learning - Regression illustrating the use of:
     
     - Regression Trees to predict taxi tip,
     b. Random Forest Regression and XGBoost to predict the price of the house
     c. Regularization in Linear Regression for Feature Engineering
     d. and evaluation metrics for Radnom Forest Regression
     
  3. Supervised Machine Learning - Classification with examples of different classifiers applied on real - life problems, such as:
     a. using KNN to classify Telecom company customers
     b. comparing Support Vector Machine to Decision Tree efficiency in credit card fraud detection
     c. using Decision Tree as a multiclass predictor on which drug might be the most appropriate for a future patient
     d. Logistic Regression to predict customer churn
     e. and evaluation metrics for binary classifiers.
     f. The folder also contains subfolder Pipelines that explores the use of Grid Search and Cross Validation to predict:
     -the possibility of rain in Australia or
     -the survival rate of passangers on Titanic.
     
  3. Unspervised Machine Learning which explores:
     a. K-Means Clustering on generated dataset 
     b. K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation
     c. HDBSCAN for Australian cities clustering
     d. DBSCAN and HDBSCAN for clustering cultural and art facilities in Canada
     e. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature space dimensionality reduction
